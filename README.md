### changes include but are not limited to:
- renames `avc` and `avc-nvenc` preset back to `mp4` and `mp4-nvenc`
- osd revamp
    - less useless text
    - shows video length
    - removed options I personally never use
- more fps and resolution options (900p, 1fps, 5fps, etc...)
- slightly different h264 encoding settings for better compatibility
