# custom mpv-webm
https://github.com/ekisu/mpv-webm, but with minor changes for my own use

### changes include:
- renames `avc` to `mp4`
- osd revamp
- more fps and resolution options
- removes options that I don't use (and seem broken most of the time)
- slightly different h264 encoding settings for increased compatibility
